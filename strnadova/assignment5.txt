shell = the UNIX command processor
option = specification of a command
standard output = the file where the program sends output, usually the terminal screen (stdout)
pipe = connects the output from one utility to the input of another:
metacharacter = characters that can stand for other characters: *, ?, [, ]
background process = the command continues running while we work on another task in the foreground
PID = process identification number
program = a set of coded inctructions contained in a file
argument = anything that follows the command name
grave accent = backward single quotation
tee = allows us to save the output from a command in a file and pipe the output to another command at once
wildcard = characters that can stand for other characters: *, ?, [, ]
foreground process = processes that require a user to interact with them
job number = number in brackets
process = what we get whenever the computer runs a program
standard input = the file where the program normally looks for input, usually keyboard (stdin) 
redirection = <, > or >>
filter = takes a stream of data from its standard input, transforms the data and sends the results to the standard output
quote = ' or "
process id number = the shell assigns PID to every process running in the background 
job control = job control commands allow us to stop processes temporarily, move foreground processes to the background and back again, and kill processes
