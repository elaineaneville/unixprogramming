question 1: 
Shell = Unix command processor
Program = set of coded instructions contained in a file
Process = what you get whenever the computer runs a program
Option = argument of a command, modifies what the command does
Argument = anything that follows the command name
Standard input = file where the program normally looks for input
Standard output = file where the program normally sends output
Grave accent = backquotes used to enclose commands that you want the shell to run
Redirection = the fact to redirect the standard output so that the output goes into an ordinary file instead.
Pipe = connects the output from one utility to the input of another, avoid creating a new file.
Tee = allows you to save the output from a command in a file and pipe the output to another command
Filter = takes a stream of a data from its standard input, tranforms the data in some way and sends the results to the standard output
Metacharacter = character that has a special meaning in unix
Wildcard = characters that can stand for other characters
Quote = what you do when you want shell to treat a special character as its original meaning and not as a code for something else in shell
Background process = process that continue running even though you’re working on another task
Foreground process = the task you’re currently working on
Process id number = number assigned to every background process, used to shut a process down
PID = process id number
Job number = allows you to be informed when the shell is ready to process another command line
Job control = allows you to run several processes in the background and eliminate them

question 2:
Would write everything contained on the current file (all the names of the files)
Would write all the file names starting with /
Would write *
Would write *
Would write nothing (a blank)
Would write all the file names containing a /
Would remove all the files

question 3: cat *ing

question 4: ls *[xX]*

question 5: cat *o*

question 6: cat b*ack*
